    parameters:
      - name: constraints
        title: Constraints
        description: Seperated string for UDM constraint layers. Name of layer and a treshold value (% of the cell covered which prevents the cell from being used). e.g greenbelt:0.5;sssi:20;

        default: 'None'

      - name: current_development
        title: Current development layer (constraint)
        type: string
        description: String for UDM current development layer, including threshold for % coverage at which cell is considered developed.
        default: 'None'
        required: true

      - name: attractors
        title: Attractors (for future development)
        type: string

      - name: people_per_dwelling
        title: People per dwelling
        type: number

        description: The threshold for percentage coverage for the combined constraint layers. All above threshold cannot be developed
        default: 50.0
        required: true

      - name: minimum_plot_size
        title: Minimum plot size
